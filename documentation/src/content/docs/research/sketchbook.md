- how can I lean towards octopodes as described by an hpc co-design initiative ([Preparing for the future -- Rethinking proxy apps](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.07336))
    - abstract definition of algorithms using flexible and parametrized building blocks (the so called "Octopodes")
    - example of octopode : matrix multiplication
    - contacted jens domke, one of the authors
- reinforcement learning for optimizing implementation? (ex: [google chips ai design](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03544-w))
- i could try direct approach (no building blocks) to compare to building block methods like
    - train an model like monocoder to use deal II to autogenerate sim codes
