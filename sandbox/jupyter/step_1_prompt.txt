Approximate the solution of the Poisson problem -Î”u=f in a two-dimensional circular domain with a hole using lowest order continuous finite elements (Q1) on a quadrilateral mesh. Enumerate degrees of freedom (DoFs) associated with mesh vertices, output their spatial distribution, analyze the sparsity pattern of the resulting system matrix, and improve matrix bandwidth by renumbering DoFs using the Cuthill-McKee algorithm.
